# geckiine

This tool installs both TCPGecko and Cafiine into the system memory so that you can use them at the same time.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
* Wii U (on firmware version 4.1.0 or higher)
* Homebrew Launcher
* a cafiine server (examples: [the original by Chadderz and MrRean](https://github.com/MrRean/Cafiine-410-551/blob/master/server/cafiine_server.exe), [MusicRandomizer](https://github.com/OatmealDome/SplatoonUtilities/blob/master/MusicRandomizer/README.md), [Ray's custom server](https://github.com/Syroot/CafiineServer), and more)
* Your computer's local IP ([Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15291/windows-find-pc-ip-address), [macOS](http://osxdaily.com/2010/11/21/find-ip-address-mac/))

### Instructions

Note: It is highly recommended that you set a static IP for your computer when using geckiine. For more information, click [here](https://github.com/OatmealDome/SplatoonUtilities/blob/master/Misc/StaticIPGuide.md).

0. Find your computer's local IP address. If you set a static IP because of the above recommendation, that static IP is your computer's local IP address.)
1. There are two possible ways to get a geckiine.elf file with your IP address.

   a. Go to [content.oatmealdome.me/geckiine/](https://content.oatmealdome.me/geckiine/) and enter in your IP address. Click the download button and extract the ZIP file.

   b. Download ```geckiine.zip``` with Geckiine Creator from [here](https://github.com/seresaa/geckiine-creator/releases/tag/v0.1) and extract it. Run ```Geckiine Creator.exe```, enter in your IP address into the four boxes, and click the "Create/Patch ELF" button.
3. Copy the ```geckiine``` folder to the ```wiiu/apps/``` folder on your SD card.
4. Insert your SD card into the Wii U and launch the Homebrew Launcher from [loadiine.ovh](http://loadiine.ovh).
5. Start a cafiine server on your computer.
6. Scroll to the "geckiine" application, tap on it, and tap the "Start" button. You will be returned to the Wii U menu.
7. Launch the game you want to modify.
8. Run any TCPGecko scripts and/or connect with TCPGecko dotNET/JGeckoU.

Shoutouts to everyone at the Splatoon Modding Hub Discord, because I probably annoyed them by talking endlessly about the various problems I encountered.
